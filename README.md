# Niagara Street Library

A tool to help me catalogue my personal library and track who I've lent books to.

## Setup

- Built using [React Remix](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
